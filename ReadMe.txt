For the Assignment, with Question 1. Build a hotel website, I have tried to do everything, except for:
+ The Admin log in and altering the web page.
+ There are code for API storage load, but it does not seem to function properly. The code is in the <script> tage of hotelListing.html.

For part B, I have tried to do everything, except for:
+ Admin being able to change price based on the date of check in and check out.

Furthermore, I have not been able to host my website on any hosting service. So the website can only be accessed and used from the .rar file only.
